# DeployedImage<a name="API_DeployedImage"></a>

Gets the Amazon EC2 Container Registry path of the docker image of the model that is hosted in this [ProductionVariant](API_ProductionVariant.md)\.

If you used the `registry/repository[:tag]` form to specify the image path of the primary container when you created the model hosted in this `ProductionVariant`, the path resolves to a path of the form `registry/repository[@digest]`\. A digest is a hash value that identifies a specific version of an image\. For information about Amazon ECR paths, see [Pulling an Image](http://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-pull-ecr-image.html) in the *Amazon ECR User Guide*\.
