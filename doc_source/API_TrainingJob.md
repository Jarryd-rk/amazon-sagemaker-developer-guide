 **SecondaryStatus**   <a name="SageMaker-Type-TrainingJob-SecondaryStatus"></a>
 Provides detailed information about the state of the training job\. For detailed information about the secondary status of the training job, see `StatusMessage` under [SecondaryStatusTransition](API_SecondaryStatusTransition.md)\.  
Amazon SageMaker provides primary statuses and secondary statuses that apply to each of them:    
InProgress  
+  `Starting` \- Starting the training job\.
+  `Downloading` \- An optional stage for algorithms that support `File` training input mode\. It indicates that data is being downloaded to the ML storage volumes\.
+  `Training` \- Training is in progress\.
+  `Uploading` \- Training is complete and the model artifacts are being uploaded to the S3 location\.  
Completed  
+  `Completed` \- The training job has completed\.  
Failed  
+  `Failed` \- The training job has failed\. The reason for the failure is returned in the `FailureReason` field of `DescribeTrainingJobResponse`\.  
Stopped  
+  `MaxRuntimeExceeded` \- The job stopped because it exceeded the maximum allowed runtime\.
+  `Stopped` \- The training job has stopped\.  
Stopping  
+  `Stopping` \- Stopping the training job\.
Valid values for `SecondaryStatus` are subject to change\. 
We no longer support the following secondary statuses:  
+  `LaunchingMLInstances` 
+  `PreparingTrainingStack` 
+  `DownloadingTrainingImage` 
Type: String  
Valid Values:` Starting | LaunchingMLInstances | PreparingTrainingStack | Downloading | DownloadingTrainingImage | Training | Uploading | Stopping | Stopped | MaxRuntimeExceeded | Completed | Failed`   
Required: No

Required: No

 **StoppingCondition**   <a name="SageMaker-Type-TrainingJob-StoppingCondition"></a>
Specifies a limit to how long a model training job can run\. When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training job\. Use this API to cap model training costs\.  
To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the `SIGTERM` signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds\. Algorithms can use this 120\-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost\.

Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items\. Maximum number of 50 items\.  
Required: No

 **TrainingEndTime**   <a name="SageMaker-Type-TrainingJob-TrainingEndTime"></a>
Indicates the time when the training job ends on training instances\. You are billed for the time interval between the value of `TrainingStartTime` and this time\. For successful jobs and stopped jobs, this is the time after model artifacts are uploaded\. For failed jobs, this is the time when Amazon SageMaker detects a job failure\.

The status of the training job\.  
Training job statuses are:

The start time in CloudWatch Logs might be later than this time\. The difference is due to the time it takes to download the training data and to the size of the training container\.  
Type: Timestamp  
Required: No

 **TuningJobArn**   <a name="SageMaker-Type-TrainingJob-TuningJobArn"></a>
